# What is it?

A quick tool for storing stuff I like, either found on Amazon or live.
I'm thinking of keeping pictures in a specific album, as some apps do, if available, an if an url is given, parsing it. If the gift is on Amazon, use the API. 
Maybe add other APIs later on.

# How does it work?

Not sure yet. That's part of the process...

The core is the list of gifts, items that I like and have gifted or intend to gift.
Gifts that I intend to gift might have no person yet, or they might be set to a person and a future date.

#APIs

It's obviously practical if I can connect to AdressBook, for things like birthdays or delivery adresses : https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/ContactData/Conceptual/AddressBookProgrammingGuideforiPhone/Chapters/UI_Controllers.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007744-CH5-SW1

Integration with Reminders would also be tremendously cool : https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/EventKitProgGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html

Photographs require integration with the Library : https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios//documentation/Photos/Reference/Photos_Framework/index.html

Amazon itself: https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html

Hey, Siri? OK, maybe not right now ;)
Alexa sounds like an option too : https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa
